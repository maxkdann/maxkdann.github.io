This is just a list of books that I've read recently that I thought were interesting or told a good story.

## Dark Pools by James Patterson

A sequel to the Quants, this book tells the true story of reclusive programmer Josh Levine. Levine changed the stock market from an institution that bought and sold stocks through humans to the lightning fast system it is today. His creation Island was bought by Nasdaq for $500M.

## A Man For All Markets by Edward Thorp

Edward Thorp is not just the guy who invented card counting. His autobiography tells the stories of his dealings with New York mobsters, brilliant mathmeticians, and how he ran an incredibly successful hedge fund for almost 30 years.

## The Every by Dave Eggers

A cautionary tale of what a future where cancel culture continues, monopolies dominate, and technology rules all.

## The Four by Scott Galloway

An incredibly witty business book. Scott Galloway breaks down Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, explains why these companies are the "Four Horseman" of the business world. Galloway has an impressive background himself, the insight he brings to these companies is massive.

## The Quants by James Patterson

"This book is making me want to drop out of university and trade stocks fulltime" is what I told my mom while reading this. Patterson winds this non-fiction tale into an incredible story that follows some of the worlds' most famous quants, both how they conquered Wall Street, and then almost destroyed it.

## The Soul Of A New Machine by Tracy Kidder

Disclaimer: You will not enjoy this book if you are not a technical person, reading 3 pages about ALUs is not for the faint of heart.

Disclaimer aside this book was brilliantly written, I had no idea it was non-fiction until the very last page. It details a small computer startup in the dawn of the age of computers. You learn not only about how these computers work, but how the people building them work as well.

## Investing Against The Tide by Anthony Bolton

Anthony Bolton was a successful portfolio manager at Fidelity for many years. I enjoyed this book for his strategies, but also because I worked at Fidelity as well.

## 10 1/2 Lessons From Experience by Paul Marshall

A pocket sized investment manual, this book was a great reminder of some of the larger themes in the investment landscape.

## One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch

THE BEST book to read for someone just starting out in investments. This books comes full of personal stories, explanations, and charts. Read the entire thing in a weekend.
